## Description

This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common
sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no idea that it'd be this
hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't require programming abilities from 
the players. Hopefully we made an interesting challenge for the new ones.

Leviathan’s levels are called leviathan0, leviathan1, … etc. and can be accessed on leviathan.labs.overthewire.org through SSH on port 2223.

*To login to the first level use:*

**Username:** leviathan0

**Password:** leviathan0

Data for the levels can be found in the homedirectories. You can look at /etc/leviathan_pass for the various level passwords.
