## Bandit Level 15 --> Level 16
### Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

### Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

### Solution

we can send pass to ssl server in port 30001 by sslopen toolkit
```console
bandit15@bandit:~$ echo "BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr" | openssl  s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify error:num=18:self signed certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify return:1
