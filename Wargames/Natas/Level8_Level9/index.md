* In this page page it is obvious that what we will write in previous textbox will be inject in linux command "grep -i $code dictionary.txt"
* So we can inject command to get our target by write ";cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;" in textbox so the command will be as follow:
```bash
grep -i ;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10; dictionary.txt
